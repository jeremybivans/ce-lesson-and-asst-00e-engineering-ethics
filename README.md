1.2.1:
The most generic definition for ethics I could find would be a set of standards or rules set in place for the betterment of a group as a whole vs the individual. I found a few interesting sections on the database, the first was The Ethics of Manipulation. On first instinct it seems like it is always unethical but there were some cases mentioned that could be the exception, like manipulating people for the greater good. Computer and information ethics was next, because it pertains to my field. Finally, I found the Chinese ethics section interesting as well.
1.2.2: Aristotle wrote that moral responsibility lays within individual people. People need to make conscious choices to do good and the end goal humans have is to be happy.
2.2.2: The centerpiece of human society that wouldn't exist would be the judicial system. If everyone was ethical, they would be working towards the greater good without a focus on the individual. If everyone works for a societal good and laws exist for societal good as well, then people wouldn't break laws. If laws aren't broken then there's no need for enforcement or trials. 
2.2.3: The most prevalent ‘event’ in recent history that fits this example would be the lockdown of airports in response to the 9/11 terror attacks. In that case, we traded personal freedoms, privacy, and comfort for national security and safety. 
3.2.1: 
3.2.2: The most prominent Covid-19 ethical dilema comes from the incredibily difficult decision to open the US back up so quickly after the declaration of a global pandemic. Having to choose between economic loss and loss of life has been a huge ethics issue.
