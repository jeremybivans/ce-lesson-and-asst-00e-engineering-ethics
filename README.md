1.2.1:
The most generic definition for ethics I could find would be a set of standards or rules set in place for the betterment of a group as a whole vs the individual. I found a few interesting sections on the database, the first was The Ethics of Manipulation. On first instinct it seems like it is always unethical but there were some cases mentioned that could be the exception, like manipulating people for the greater good. Computer and information ethics was next, because it pertains to my field. Finally, I found the Chinese ethics section interesting as well.
1.2.2: Aristotle wrote that moral responsibility lays within individual people. People need to make conscious choices to do good and the end goal humans have is to be happy.
2.2.2: The centerpiece of human society that wouldn't exist would be the judicial system. If everyone was ethical, they would be working towards the greater good without a focus on the individual. If everyone works for a societal good and laws exist for societal good as well, then people wouldn't break laws. If laws aren't broken then there's no need for enforcement or trials. 
2.2.3: The most prevalent ‘event’ in recent history that fits this example would be the lockdown of airports in response to the 9/11 terror attacks. In that case, we traded personal freedoms, privacy, and comfort for national security and safety. 
3.2.1: 
3.2.2: The most prominent Covid-19 ethical dilema comes from the incredibily difficult decision to open the US back up so quickly after the declaration of a global pandemic. Having to choose between economic loss and loss of life has been a huge ethics issue. China started under/misreporting their numbers brings up the dilema between giving accurate numbers to keep people aware of the seriousness of the pandemic and putting people at ease and not panicked. Citizens in the US have been having to choose between their own personal 'freedoms' and the beterment of global health and safety. It seems like a very vocal population is chosing the former over the latter in the guise of 'freedom'. 
4.2.1: In general the Code of Ethics for the ACM makes a lot of sense. A focus on privacy/ security and innovation makes sense. Thoroughly learning about the ins and outs of computers also makes sense. The only portion that was confusing to me was 2.6, only performing work in areas of compentence. I feel like this limits the tasks and projects people can work on.
4.2.2: This code is aimed at open source developers on Microsofts platfroms and communities. Providing and welcoming and inspiration community is the goal of the code of conduct. Github is an OSS that we've been using.
4.2.3: Analysis and collection of large amounts of data by big companies is the primary concern for data ethics. Having access to these large amounts of data could lead to its exploitation for money, breaches of privacy, etc.
4.2.4: The code is necessary for the conference because it sets a standard for anyone participating in the conference. All presentations, workshops, etc. will be held to the same standard and are therefor all endorced by the brand/ group.
4.2.5: Google is concerned with AI being developed with the prejudices and bias' that its makers have and making sure AI isn't self governing.  The features, along with technology that causes direct harm, are the responsibility of the programmer to not implement. Making AI responsive to general ethical stances humans have (killing, harm, law) makes the technology safe for us to utilize and explore.
4.2.6: Ethics are a set of rules and morals set up to be for the good of a group of people. Hackers exploit holes in security and weaknesses to get access to data and other things stored in computers/networks. Ethical hacking is an interesting phenomena where 'white hat' hackers use their skills to find these exploitations and expose them for the owner of these networks and computer systems. They're like security companies testing their alarms and other protection before selling it to the consumer. The terms ethical and hacker are not mutually exclusive by definition, the negative connotation of the word hacker makes it seem oxymoronic.
